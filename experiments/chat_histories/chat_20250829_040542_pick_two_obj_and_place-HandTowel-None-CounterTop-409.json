This step is critical as it completes the exploration of all drawers, potentially revealing the second item needed for task completion.\n- If drawer 6 is empty or lacks a suitable item, I will need to reassess my strategy and explore other areas or objects in the environment.\n</think>\n\n<action>\naction_choice: open drawer 6\n</action>"
