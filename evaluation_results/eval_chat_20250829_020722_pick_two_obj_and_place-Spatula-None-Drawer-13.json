      "score": 2.0,
      "reasoning": "The Memory Recall module demonstrated significant gaps in recall and failed to leverage important past experiences effectively. Across the 10 steps, there was a consistent pattern of repeating previously failed approaches without adaptation. The module did not show evidence of learning from past attempts, as it continued to recall previous exploration attempts without any indication of change or improvement in strategy. This suggests poor pattern recognition and a lack of systematic tracking of progress.",

      "score": 1.0,
      "reasoning": "The Reflection module consistently failed to provide any meaningful analysis or insights throughout the task. Each step was marked by a repetitive statement of 'Continuing systematic exploration,' which indicates a lack of engagement with the task outcomes. There was no identification of successes or failures, no causal reasoning, and no metacognitive awareness. The module did not adapt or change its strategy based on the task's progress, leading to a failure in task completion.",

      "reasoning": "The agent consistently chose the 'look' action across all steps without any variation or adaptation, which indicates a lack of progress toward the task objective of putting two spatulas in a drawer.
